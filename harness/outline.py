"""Silhouettes straight from the geometry — no browser, no renderer, no images to read.

    python3 harness/outline.py <model.glb> <outdir> [--prev <dir>] [--views front,side,top,hero]

WHY. The silhouette is the single most-used measurement in this harness, and
until now getting one meant launching a headless Chromium, loading three.js,
uploading the mesh to a GPU, drawing it black-on-white, and reading the pixels
back. That is a lot of machinery to answer a question the vertices already
contain: this is low-poly, a few thousand triangles, and the outline of a solid
under a known camera is arithmetic.

So this projects the triangles and fills them. Same camera the renderer used
(perspective, 30 degrees, distance = longest dimension x 2.4, 640x640, same view
directions and up vectors), same mask convention, same metrics. The point is not
only speed — it is that the numbers stop being *estimates read off a picture*
and become the thing itself.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT REPLACE. It cannot tell you WHAT the shape looks like. "Is
this a bison" is a judgment about resemblance and it needs eyes; that is the
blind reader's job and no amount of coordinate data does it. What this removes
is everything AROUND that question — aspect, protrusions, thinnest feature,
round-to-round similarity — so the reader can be handed one picture and one
question instead of thirteen pictures and a questionnaire.

    time, so the flat albedo already carries the gradient, the seams, the ambient
    occlusion and the rim. Rendering it again with three-point studio lighting was
    lighting a photograph. The z-buffer here decides occlusion exactly as it does
