"""Silhouette measurement report (MEASURES ONLY — judgment belongs to the LLM).
usage: python3 maskmetrics.py <outdir> <img1.png> [img2.png ...]
Per image: crops to content, writes <stem>_thumb24.png / _thumb48.png and
metrics to <outdir>/metrics.json. Also writes sheet.png (all views side by side).
Descriptors: W_over_H, fill, thirds_cols, thirds_rows, compactness
(perimeter^2/4πA: 1=disc, higher=spikier/branchier), neg_pockets (enclosed
whitespace count+sizes), protrusions (direction & sharpness of major limbs/spikes),
com (centre of mass position in bbox, 0..1)."""
